My employer [qwiet.ai](https://qwiet.ai/) fortunately allows us to contribute back to open source, and I'm sure many of our projects will be useful to others in the Scala community. One of them is [Scala Repl PP](https://github.com/mpollmeier/scala-repl-pp), or short `srp`

It enhances the stock Scala 3 REPL with pretty rendering (pprint), dependency handling, better scripting, runBefore code etc. You can embed it into your project as a regular library dependency. It replicates much of what Ammonite did for us in Scala 2 - thanks Haoyi et al!

Now also featuring a proper ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è readme üòÖ
